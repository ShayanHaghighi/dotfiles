#  The current answers are good, but do not talk about how they are just
#  [syntactic sugar][1] to some pattern that we are so used to.
#  
#  Let's start with an example, say we have 10 numbers, and we want a
#  subset of those that are greater than, say, 5.

 >>> numbers = [12, 34, 1, 4, 4, 67, 37, 9, 0, 81]

#  For the above task, the below approaches below are totally identical
#  to one another, and go from most verbose to concise, readable and
#  ***pythonic***:
#  
#  ##Approach 1

 result = []
 for index in range(len(numbers)):
     if numbers[index] > 5:
         result.append(numbers[index])
 print result  #Prints [12, 34, 67, 37, 9, 81]

#  ##Approach 2 (Slightly cleaner, for-in loops)

 result = []
 for number in numbers:
     if number > 5:
         result.append(number)
 print result  #Prints [12, 34, 67, 37, 9, 81]

#  ##Approach 3 (Enter List Comprehension)

 result = [number for number in numbers if number > 5]

#  ##or more generally:

 [function(number) for number in numbers if condition(number)]

#  where:
#  
 #  - `function(x)` takes an `x` and transforms it into something useful
#  (like for instance: `x*x`)
 #  - if `condition(x)` returns any False-y value (False, None, empty
#  string, empty list, etc ..) then the current iteration will be skipped
#  (think `continue`). If the function return a non-False-y value then
#  the current value makes it to the final resultant array (and goes
#  through the transformation step above).
#  
#  To understand the syntax in a slightly different manner, look at the
#  Bonus section below.
#  
#  For further information, follow the tutorial all other answers have
#  linked: [List Comprehension][2]

#  
#  ##Bonus
#  (Slightly un-pythonic, but putting it here for sake of completeness)
#  
#  The example above can be written as:

 result = filter(lambda x: x > 5, numbers)

#  The general expression above can be written as:

 result = map(function, filter(condition, numbers)) #result is a list in Py2
