#  You can't use it like that. The `or` operator must have two boolean
#  operands. You have a boolean and a string. You can write

 weather == "Good!" or weather == "Great!": 

#  or

 weather in ("Good!", "Great!"): 

#  What you have written is parsed as

 (weather == "Good") or ("Great")

#  In the case of python, non-empty strings always evaluate to `True`, so
#  this condition will always be true.
