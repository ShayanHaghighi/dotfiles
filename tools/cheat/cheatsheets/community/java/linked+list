/*
 * If you need a general-purpose `List`, use `java.util.LinkedList`. It's
 * a standard class, mature, well-tested, well-understood by almost any
 * Java dev... and, ofc, it's concise, because you don't have to
 * implement it.
 * 
 * Actually, don't use it: use `java.util.ArrayList` or
 * `java.util.ArrayDeque`, they out-perform `LinkedList` in almost all
 * circumstances. See [When to use LinkedList over ArrayList in
 * Java?](https:stackoverflow.com/questions/322715/when-to-use-
 * linkedlist-over-arraylist-in-java)
 * 
 * If you _really_ need something more specialized, implement your own,
 * but only if you _really, really_ need it.
 * 
 * Only make your class implement `java.util.List` if you actually need
 * it to.
 * 
 * A good starting point to avoid having to implement "everything" in the
 * interface is to extend [`java.util.AbstractList`](https:docs.oracle.
 * com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/AbstractList.html): this only requires
 * you to provide an implementation of `get(int)`, `size()` and, if you
 * want the list to be modifiable, `set(int, E)` (you may well want to
 * override others to get better performance for a linked list).
