/*
 * [LinkedList<E>][1] seems to a way to go, LinkedList is a doubly linked
 * list, which is good for a Queue data structure (FIFO).
 * 
 * It maintains references to the Head and Tail elements, which you can
 * get by <code>.getFirst()</code> and <code>.getLast()</code>
 * respectively.
 * 
 * You can also use `.add(E e)` to append an element to the end of the
 * queue and `.remove()` to dequeue and retrieve the head (first element)
 * of the queue.
