# Remove your semicolon.

 for i in `seq 2`; do echo "$i"; done > out.dat

# **SUGGESTIONS**
# 
# Also as suggested by Fredrik Pihl, try not to use external binaries
# when they are not needed, or at least when practically not:

 for i in {1..2}; do echo "$i"; done > out.dat
 for ((i = 1; i <= 2; ++i )); do echo "$i"; done > out.dat
 for i in 1 2; do echo "$i"; done > out.dat

# Also, be careful of outputs in `words` that may cause pathname
# expansion.

 for A in $(echo '*'); do echo "$A"; done

# Would show your files instead of just a literal `*`.
# 
# `$()` is also recommended as a clearer syntax for command substitution
# in Bash and POSIX shells than backticks (`` ` ``), and it supports
# nesting.
# 
# The cleaner solutions as well for reading output to variables are

 while read VAR; do
     ...   
 done < <(do something)

# And

 read ... < <(do something)  ## Could be done on a loop or with readarray.

 for A in "${ARRAY[@]}"; do
     :
 done

# Using printf can also be an easier alternative with respect to the
# intended function:

 printf '%s\n' {1..2} > out.dat
