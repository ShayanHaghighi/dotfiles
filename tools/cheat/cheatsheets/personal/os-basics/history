# UNIX Roots
#  Bell Labs created UNIX with the kernel + shell + utilities split, inspiring later systems.

# GNU and GPL
#  Stallman launched the GNU project and the GPL to keep software free after AT&T tightened UNIX licensing.

# Linux Arrival
#  Linus Torvalds wrote the Linux kernel, which paired with GNU userland to form GNU/Linux.

# BSD Lineage
#  BSD derivatives feed macOS and many appliances (NeXTSTEP -> Darwin -> XNU).

# Windows Path
#  Windows evolved from an MS-DOS shell to the NT kernel family starting with XP.
